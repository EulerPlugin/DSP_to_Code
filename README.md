# DSP to Code

The goal of this project is to learn how to implement DSP diagrams in actual code.

Using Python, we stepped through filters and effects with visualizations and audio examples.

Key systems such as soft clippers, delays, FIR, and IIR filters were implemented from their difference equations.

All implementations prioritize clarity, using simple arrays and loops without optimization tricks.

This project serves as a foundation for understanding how core DSP concepts translate directly into code.
